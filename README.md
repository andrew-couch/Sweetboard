# Sweetboard
## Dashboard for conducting sentiment analysis, text mining, and other analyses on Twitter data
### [Demonstration Video](https://youtu.be/M26o-RizrUA)
### There are two R scripts, Sweetboard.R which is the dashboard found on Rshiny and Sweetboard-With-Token.R
### Sweetboard-With-Token will use get_token() from Rtweet to retrieve a user's API token which avoids manually typing in the API token every time Sweetboard is used
